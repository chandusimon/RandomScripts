/**
 * When I was working with Teradata and Linux sh scripts, I mostly used this script to do the migration 
 * instead of having to login to IPSwitch and manually do it myself typing every command 
 * This was very helpful at the time because we had no local server to test teradata or linux scripts
 * so even a single line code need to be pushed to server to be tested
